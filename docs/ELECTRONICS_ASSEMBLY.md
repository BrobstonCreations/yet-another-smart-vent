## Electronics Assembly
Feel free to follow along in [this video which is slightly out of date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D073FX6kdh8) or read the written instructions below:

1. Snap off header pins from one of the header pin blocks that came with your components. You will need a header pin for 5V, GND, D3, A0, and 3V3. The first four are needed, the 3V3 pin is just to add rigidity between the D1 Mini and the DC Power Shield.
2. I would recommend pressing these header pins into a breadboard (long side down) in the correct pattern for the above noted pins on the D1 Mini, this will make soldering the pins to the D1 mini much easier.
3. Press the D1 Mini on to the pins in the breadboard.
4. Solder the pins to the D1 Mini.
5. Once these pins are soldered, I would recommend removing the D1 Mini from the breadboard and clip it into a [third hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helping_hand_(tool)).
6. Now you should be able to press the DC Power Shield onto the pins you soldered to the D1 Mini. Be sure to insert the [spacer](https://www.printables.com/model/259295-esp-shield-solder-spacer) before soldering.

7. Solder the pins to the DC Power Shield.
8. Remove the spacer.
9. Cut the wires on the Servo Motor to a length of 2-2.5 inches.
10. Strip 1/4-3/8 of an inch of insulation off the end of each wire on the Servo Motor.
11. Tin the wires on the Servo Motor and each of the corresponding pins on the top of the Power Shield (5V, GND, D3, and A0).
12. Solder the wires to the top of the Power Shield:
    - DFRobot DMS-MG90-A: red wire to 5V, the black wire to GND, the white wire to D3, and the brown wire to A0.
    - Batan B2122: red wire to 5V, the brown wire to GND, the yellow wire to D3, and the white wire to A0.
13. Cut two of the left over wires to the length of 2-2.5 inches.
14. Strip 1/4-3/8 of an inch of insulation off both ends of each wire.
15. Tin the wires.
16. Insert the wires through the limit switch pin holes.
17. Solder the wires to the limit switch pins.
18. Solder the other ends to 3V3 and D0. It does not matter which is connected to which.
