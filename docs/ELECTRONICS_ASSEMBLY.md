## Electronics Assembly
Eventually I intend to add pictures, but for now these instructions should work.

1. Snap off header pins from one of the header pin blocks that came with your components. You will need a header pin for 5V, GND, D3, A0, and 3V3. The first four are needed, the 3V3 pin is just to add rigidity between the D1 Mini and the DC Power Shield.
2. I would recommend pressing these header pins into a breadboard (long side down) in the correct pattern for the above noted pins on the D1 Mini, this will make soldering the pins to the D1 mini much easier.
3. Press the D1 Mini on to the pins in the breadboard.
4. Solder the pins to the D1 Mini.
5. Once these pins are soldered, I would recommend removing the D1 Mini from the breadboard and clip it into a [third hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helping_hand_(tool)).
6. Now you should be able to press the DC Power Shield onto the pins you soldered to the D1 Mini. Be sure to insert the spacer, there will be an STL file provided to print this. There is a picture of the spacer and the correct orientation to connect the DC Power Shield in the [Assembly Instructions](/VENT_ASSEMBLY.md).
7. Solder the pins to the DC Power Shield.
8. Remove the spacer.
9. Cut the wires on the Batan B2122 to a length of 2-2.5 inches.
10. Strip 1/4-3/8 of an inch of insulation off the end of each wire on the Batan B2122.
11. Tin the wires on the Batan B2122 and each of the pins (5V, GND, D3, and A0).
12. Solder the red wire to 5V, the brown wire to GND, the yellow wire to D3, and the white wire to A0.
