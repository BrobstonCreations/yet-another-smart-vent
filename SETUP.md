## Setup

This project using [WifiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager), when you first power your vent on, it will go into setup mode, which broadcasts as a WiFi Access Point. You will need to connect to this WiFi Acces Point from your computer of phone and fill out the fields to give the vent the necessary information to connect to your WiFi network and your MQTT Broker. I occasionally have issues with this on my phone (I assume something with copying/pasting from my password manager), so if you have any trouble, try using a computer that can connct to WiFi.  The pictures below give you an idea of what this process looks like:
